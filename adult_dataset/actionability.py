"""

Rules are written as lambda functions over transitions, with x0 = start point and x1 = end point.
NOTE: Rules should return True if the transition is ***not*** actionable.
NOTE: Add new rule at the end, ensuring dictionary key is higher than previous one.

Variable order: ["age","employment-type","education-num","occupation","race","sex","weekly-hours"]

See adult_categories.json and adult_udm_bin_edges.json for category order and bin definitions.
